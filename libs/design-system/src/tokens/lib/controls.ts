/**
 * Interactive-control geometry.
 *
 * DERIVED, not sourced from `colors_and_type.css` — that file has no notion of
 * a control height, and every other token module in this lib is a byte-faithful
 * copy of it. The values below are read off the finished visual design
 * (`doc/design/lets-park-design.dc.html`), which sizes its buttons, inputs and
 * selects with literal pixel heights. Keeping them here — rather than inline in
 * the primitives — is what lets `libs/design-system/src/primitives` stay free of
 * hand-written pixel values.
 *
 * They are their own token group rather than aliases onto `--space-*` because
 * two of the four (36px, 56px) are not on that scale at all, and because a
 * control height is not a spacing value even where the numbers coincide —
 * 40px and 48px do land on `--space-10` and `--space-12`, and routing them
 * through the spacing namespace would also mint `w-control-lg` and
 * `p-control-lg`, which mean nothing (see the note in `assets/theme.css`).
 *
 * See `doc/decision/0011-derived-control-tokens-and-rounding.md` for why the
 * design's seven distinct heights collapse to four steps.
